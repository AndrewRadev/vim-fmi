# README

This project is the website for the Vim course at Sofia University: <https://vim-fmi.bg>. It's all in Bulgarian, so it's probably a bit of a niche setup.

The vast majority of the code has been borrowed from <https://github.com/skanev/evans>, which I've been using for a Rust course (<https://fmi.rust-lang.bg>) under [my own fork](https://github.com/andrewradev/evans).

The exercise setup has been taken from <https://github.com/igrigorik/vimgolf>, the excellent site and client for <https://vimgolf.com>.
